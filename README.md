### About the data
All of the data used for this project can be found in the [`data`](https://github.com/HindustanTimesLabs/rohingya-village-fires/tree/master/data) directory. Most of the files in the directory were used for mapping. The source data for the story is in the file called [`myanmar-fires.csv`](https://github.com/HindustanTimesLabs/rohingya-village-fires/blob/master/data/myanmar-fires.csv). This was provided to the Hindustan Times by Amnesty International on 15 September, 2017. Here is their description of the data collection:
> The spreadsheet has the coordinates + the date the fire was detected. Please note that the locations are not village locations, but the locations of active fires that were detected by satellite sensors; the locations of the fires overlap with, or are in close proximity to, villages.

Furthermore, in the [press release](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/09/myanmar-scorched-earth-campaign-fuels-ethnic-cleansing-of-rohingya-from-rakhine-state/) Amensty published on 14 September, 2017, about the village burnings, they provide the following information about the data:
> Due to sensor limitations, actual number of fires is likely higher. Eyewitness testimony, images and videos suggest a higher number of affected areas. Sources: Lance Firms (fire data); MIMU (village tracts)
